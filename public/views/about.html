            <p>Words of Code is organized by the tech folks at Renovo Solutions in Hartville, Ohio - a small group within our company, where we build great software that makes people's lives better, using cool technology that rocks our socks.</p>
            <p>We're passionate about many things - programming, software development conferences, hacking on stuff outside our daily focus, and continually improving our technical chops. We love meetups, workshops, hackathons, and other opportunities to network with fellow and future programmers of all ages and skills. We also enjoy social events, odd and sometimes dangerous outdoor games, food, building relationships, and talking about software development, methodologies, frameworks and tools.</p>
            <p>We are strongly connected to the Hartville community we live and work in, and are interested in promoting awareness of software design and development, and helping to increase software literacy and competency of anyone who's interested in learning together. We want to both teach and learn.</p>
            <p>Internally, we use this stuff, though we're interested & experienced in a lot more:</p>
